# Abstract: Enhanced ELO Rating System for KBO League Season Prediction Using Traditional Baseball Statistics

## Background
The Korean Baseball Organization (KBO) League lacks advanced tracking data such as Statcast metrics, necessitating reliance on traditional box score statistics for performance analysis. This constraint presents both challenges and opportunities for developing predictive models in professional baseball. While existing ELO systems have been successfully applied to various sports, their effectiveness in capturing the nuanced aspects of baseball performance using limited statistical inputs remains questionable. This study addresses the critical need for accurate season-level predictions in data-constrained environments through innovative statistical modeling approaches.

## Objective
This research aims to develop a comprehensive season prediction system for KBO League by creating an Enhanced ELO rating framework that maximizes information extraction from traditional baseball statistics. The primary objectives include: (1) quantifying individual player talent levels through multi-dimensional ability decomposition, (2) implementing Bayesian uncertainty quantification to handle small sample limitations, (3) constructing Monte Carlo-based game simulation engines for probabilistic outcome modeling, and (4) achieving season-level predictive accuracy comparable to advanced metric-based systems.

## Methods
We propose a five-phase methodology utilizing empirical analysis of 251,881 plate appearances from 2021-2025 KBO seasons. **Phase 1** develops the core Enhanced ELO system incorporating KBO-specific linear weights (HR: 1.717, 3B: 1.425, 2B: 1.031, 1B: 0.732) and situational enhancement factors, particularly for Runners in Scoring Position scenarios (enhancement multipliers: Single 2.42×, Double 2.52×, Triple 1.49×, Home Run 1.29×). **Phase 2** extends the framework to multi-dimensional player abilities through traditional statistics decomposition: batting abilities (Contact, Power, Plate Discipline), pitching abilities (Stuff, Command, Stamina), and defensive capabilities estimated through error rates and positional adjustments. **Phase 3** implements Monte Carlo game simulation with state-dependent probability calculations, incorporating managerial strategy modeling and fatigue effects. **Phase 4** integrates full season simulation with dynamic rating updates, injury modeling, and team optimization algorithms. **Phase 5** validates the system through comprehensive backtesting on 2022-2024 seasons and real-time performance monitoring.

## Key Innovations
The system introduces several methodological innovations to overcome data limitations: **Bayesian ELO updates** provide stable evaluations with limited samples by incorporating prior distributions based on league averages and player experience levels. **Situational ability differentiation** captures performance variations across game contexts (count situations, inning effects, opponent handedness) through empirically-derived adjustment factors. **Dynamic parameter adaptation** enables real-time model calibration based on observed performance patterns. **Uncertainty quantification** accompanies all predictions with confidence intervals, acknowledging inherent limitations of traditional statistics while maximizing their informational value.

## Expected Results
The system targets performance benchmarks that establish new standards for traditional statistics-based baseball prediction: ELO-OPS correlation coefficient exceeding 0.70, individual game prediction accuracy above 55%, season win total RMSE below 0.05, and playoff qualification prediction accuracy surpassing 80%. Preliminary validation on historical data demonstrates correlation coefficients of R=0.578-0.646 with established batting metrics while maintaining mathematical zero-sum properties essential for ELO systems. The enhanced framework shows particular strength in situational performance prediction, with average enhancement factors of 1.55× for home runs and 1.21× for doubles in high-leverage situations.

## Significance and Impact
This research contributes to sports analytics by demonstrating that sophisticated predictive modeling remains feasible under severe data constraints. The methodology establishes a new paradigm for **information maximization from limited statistical inputs**, with applications extending beyond baseball to other sports facing similar data availability challenges. From a practical standpoint, the system provides actionable insights for team management, enhances fan engagement through accurate predictions, and elevates the quality of media analysis and commentary. The open-source framework enables replication and adaptation across different professional baseball leagues worldwide.

## Conclusion
The Enhanced ELO system represents a significant advancement in constraint-aware sports modeling, transforming traditional baseball statistics from perceived limitations into competitive advantages through innovative analytical approaches. By achieving high predictive accuracy without relying on advanced tracking data, this research demonstrates that fundamental statistical principles, when properly leveraged through modern computational methods, can compete with resource-intensive alternatives. The successful implementation of this system will establish KBO League as a leader in data-efficient sports analytics while providing a replicable framework for similar challenges in international professional sports.
