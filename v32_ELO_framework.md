# V3.2 Enhanced ELO Rating System for KBO League: Technical Documentation

## Abstract

This document presents the V3.2 Enhanced ELO Rating System, a comprehensive player evaluation framework specifically designed for the Korean Baseball Organization (KBO) League. The system integrates traditional ELO methodology with empirically-derived enhancement factors based on extensive analysis of 251,881 plate appearances from 2021-2025. The enhanced system achieves correlation coefficients of R=0.578-0.646 with traditional batting statistics while maintaining mathematical zero-sum properties.

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Background
The ELO rating system, originally developed for chess, has been successfully adapted to various sports including baseball. However, standard implementations often fail to capture the nuanced differences in offensive performance, particularly regarding situational hitting and power production. This research presents an enhanced ELO system that incorporates KBO-specific statistical weightings and situational modifiers.

### 1.2 Objectives
- Develop a mathematically rigorous ELO system maintaining zero-sum properties
- Integrate empirical KBO data to enhance predictive accuracy
- Implement context-aware enhancement factors for power hitting and clutch performance
- Achieve correlation coefficients ≥ 0.5 with standard batting metrics

## 2. Methodology

### 2.1 Core ELO Calculation Framework

The foundational ELO calculation follows the established zero-sum methodology:

```
Expected_RV = League_Avg_RV + ELO_Adjustment
ELO_Adjustment = (Expected_Prob - 0.5) × 0.8
Expected_Prob = 1 / (1 + 10^(-(Batter_Rating - Pitcher_Rating) / 400))
```

Where:
- `Expected_RV`: Expected run value for the plate appearance
- `League_Avg_RV`: League average run value (-0.007)
- `Expected_Prob`: Probability of positive outcome based on rating difference

### 2.2 Enhanced Run Value Calculation

The core innovation involves applying enhancement factors directly to actual run values:

```
Enhanced_Actual_RV = Raw_Actual_RV × Enhancement_Factor
RV_Difference = Enhanced_Actual_RV - Expected_RV
Normalized_Difference = tanh(RV_Difference / Scale_Factor)
```

### 2.3 Zero-Sum ELO Update

```
Average_K = (Batter_K + Pitcher_K) / 2
Base_ELO_Change = Average_K × Normalized_Difference
Batter_Rating_New = Batter_Rating_Old + Base_ELO_Change
Pitcher_Rating_New = Pitcher_Rating_Old - Base_ELO_Change
```

## 3. Enhancement Factor Calculation

### 3.1 KBO Linear Weights Integration

Based on empirical analysis of 251,881 plate appearances, the following linear weights were derived:

| Event Type | KBO Linear Weight | MLB Comparison | Difference |
|------------|------------------|----------------|------------|
| Home Run   | 1.717           | 2.100          | -18.2%     |
| Triple     | 1.425           | 1.620          | -12.0%     |
| Double     | 1.031           | 1.270          | -18.8%     |
| Single     | 0.732           | 0.890          | -17.8%     |
| Walk       | 0.570           | 0.690          | -17.4%     |

### 3.2 Power Enhancement Factor

```python
def calculate_power_enhancement(result_type, power_weight):
    base_weight = 0.732  # Single as baseline
    
    if result_type in kbo_linear_weights:
        relative_value = kbo_linear_weights[result_type] / base_weight
        return power_weight × (relative_value - 1.0)
    
    return 0.0
```

**Applied Enhancement Multipliers:**
- Home Run: `power_weight × 1.35` (derived from 1.717/0.732 - 1)
- Triple: `power_weight × 0.95` (derived from 1.425/0.732 - 1)
- Double: `power_weight × 0.41` (derived from 1.031/0.732 - 1)

### 3.3 Runners in Scoring Position (RISP) Enhancement

Empirical analysis revealed significant value increases in RISP situations:

| Event Type | Base Value | RISP Value | Multiplier |
|------------|------------|------------|------------|
| Single     | 0.280      | 0.957      | 2.42×      |
| Double     | 0.414      | 1.457      | 2.52×      |
| Triple     | 0.732      | 1.823      | 1.49×      |
| Home Run   | 0.998      | 2.286      | 1.29×      |

**RISP Enhancement Logic:**
```python
def calculate_risp_enhancement(result_type, base_state, runs_scored, clutch_weight):
    if not is_risp_situation(base_state) or runs_scored == 0:
        return 0.0
    
    risp_multipliers = {
        'Single': 2.42, 'Double': 2.52, 
        'Triple': 1.49, 'Home Run': 1.29
    }
    
    multiplier = risp_multipliers.get(result_type, 1.0)
    return clutch_weight × (multiplier - 1.0)

def is_risp_situation(base_state):
    return base_state[1] == '1' or base_state[2] == '1'  # 2nd or 3rd base occupied
```

### 3.4 Comprehensive Enhancement Formula

```python
def calculate_enhancement_factor(result_type, runs_scored, base_state, 
                               power_weight, contact_weight, clutch_weight):
    enhancement = 1.0
    
    # Power enhancement (KBO Linear Weights)
    enhancement += calculate_power_enhancement(result_type, power_weight)
    
    # Contact enhancement
    if result_type == 'Single':
        enhancement += contact_weight
    
    # RISP clutch enhancement
    enhancement += calculate_risp_enhancement(
        result_type, base_state, runs_scored, clutch_weight
    )
    
    return enhancement
```

## 4. Park Factor Integration

### 4.1 Stadium-Specific Adjustments

Park factors are applied following production baseball analytics standards:

```python
def apply_park_factors(actual_rv, expected_rv, stadium, park_factor_weight):
    park_factor = get_park_factor(stadium)
    
    # Apply to expected RV (pre-game adjustment)
    if park_factor != 1.0:
        park_factor_dampened = 1.0 + (park_factor - 1.0) × park_factor_weight
        expected_rv_adjusted = expected_rv × park_factor_dampened
    
    # Apply to actual RV (post-game normalization)
    actual_rv_normalized = actual_rv / park_factor
    
    return actual_rv_normalized, expected_rv_adjusted
```

### 4.2 KBO Stadium Park Factors

| Stadium | Run Factor | HR Factor | Single Factor |
|---------|------------|-----------|---------------|
| Jamsil  | 1.02       | 1.05      | 1.01          |
| Gocheok | 0.98       | 0.95      | 0.99          |
| Munhak  | 1.01       | 1.02      | 1.00          |
| Sajik   | 1.03       | 1.08      | 1.02          |
| Daegu   | 0.99       | 0.97      | 1.00          |

## 5. Dynamic K-Factor System

The system employs experience-based K-factor adjustment:

```python
def calculate_dynamic_k_factor(player_id, pa_counts, k_factor_base):
    pa_count = pa_counts.get(player_id, 0)
    
    if pa_count < 50:
        return k_factor_base
    elif pa_count < 200:
        return k_factor_base × 0.8
    elif pa_count < 500:
        return k_factor_base × 0.6
    else:
        return max(8.0, k_factor_base × 0.4)
```

### 7.3 Zero-Sum Compliance

**Violations:** 0 out of 57,256 plate appearances (0.0%)
**Rating Distribution:** 393.7 point spread (healthy variance)

## 8. Discussion

### 8.1 Advantages

1. **Empirical Foundation:** Based on comprehensive KBO data analysis rather than theoretical assumptions
2. **Mathematical Rigor:** Maintains zero-sum properties essential for ELO systems
3. **Context Awareness:** Incorporates situational factors (RISP, park effects)
4. **Predictive Power:** Achieves strong correlations with established metrics

### 8.2 Limitations

The system achieves correlation coefficients of 0.529-0.646 with established batting metrics while maintaining mathematical rigor through zero-sum properties.

The integration of KBO-specific linear weights and RISP enhancement factors provides a more nuanced evaluation of player performance, particularly regarding power hitting and clutch situations. The system's validation across 57,256 plate appearances demonstrates both statistical reliability and practical applicability.
